# Project Summary

The core function of the Chat-App-Node application is to enable real-time communication between users through text messages and geolocation sharing. This application uses Node.js and Socket.io to provide seamless and instantaneous messaging capabilities. Users can connect in designated chat rooms, sharing their messages and locations easily and securely.

## Nodejs Tech Stack

**Express:** build the server and handle routing
**Mustache:** Used for templating HTML. Mustache is a logic-less template syntax, which makes it easy to render data into HTML without embedding any programming logic

## APIs

**Socket.io:** Used for real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
**Geolocation:** Allows the application to access the geographical location of the users, for sharing in the chat rooms.
